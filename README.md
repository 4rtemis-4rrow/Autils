# Autils
Arrow utils: basic python scripts to do and perform basic tasks
---
## Currently included scripts
1. conv: a unit converter with support for a wide range of units, it's design make it very easy to add support for more units (as basic as adding a conversion factor to an easily readable dictionary), and it's very easy to use, run it with --help to learn how to use it
2. dur: used to calculate the total duration of a set of video files and output them in a human readable format, it has 2 dependancies, ffmpeg, and tqdm, using it is as simple as passing it 1 or more video/audio files, or passing it a path, and it will search automatically for video and audio files

if you would like more scripts, either submit a pull request, or submit an issue and I'll try to write the script whenever I'm free

note: I wrote those scripts to suit my needs, I publish them so that if anyone has the same needs, they don't have to reinvent the wheel
